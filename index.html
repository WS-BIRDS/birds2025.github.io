      <p>The first workshop on <strong>B</strong>uilding <strong>I</strong>nnovative <strong>R</strong>esearch Systems for <strong>D</strong>igital Librarie<strong>s</strong> (BIRDS)  takes place at <a href="https://tpdl2025.github.io/">TPDL 2025</a> as a full-day workshop. BIRDS addresses practitioners working in digital libraries and GLAMs as well as researchers from computational domains such as data science, information retrieval, natural language processing, and data modelling. Our interdisciplinary workshop focuses on connecting members of both worlds. One of today's biggest challenges is the increasing information flood. Large language models like ChatGPT seem to offer good performance for answering questions on the web. So, shall we just build upon that idea and use chatbots in digital libraries? Or do we need to design and develop specialized and effective access paths? Answering these questions requires to connect different communities, practitioners from real digital libraries and researchers in the area of computer science. In brief, our workshop's goal is thus to support researchers and practitioners to build the next generation of innovative and effective digital library systems.</p>
      <br>

	  <h2>Goals of the Workshop</h2>
	  <p>With our <em>highly interactive</em>, <em>in-person</em>, and <em>interdisciplinary</em> <strong>BIRDS</strong> workshop we want to strengthen the collaboration in the community, connect domain experts with researchers in different contexts and academic states, and promote the construction of innovative research systems for digital libraries.</p>

	  <ul class="list-unstyled">
	    <li>Our goals are to:
	        <ul>
	        	<li>Provide a forum to come up with collaborations between <em>domain experts</em> and <em>researchers</em> in digital libraries</li>
	            <li>Identify common challenges faced by digital libraries and explore how computational approaches could help address them</li>
	            <li>Provide a forum at TPDL to explicitly discuss rough ideas, problems and ongoing work</li>
	        </ul>
	    </li>
	</ul>

  <summary><strong>Abstract of the keynote (click to expand)</strong></summary>
Since 2023, there has been a surge of public and research interest in large language models (LLMs), which has significantly shifted the paradigm of information retrieval from returning keyword-based search results to the generation of natural language responses. This shift brings both challenges and opportunities for traditional digital libraries, which have served as a core infrastructure for browsing, searching, and accessing scholarly content. A critical question emerges: What role should digital libraries play in this LLM era? In this keynote, we share our vision of digital libraries in the LLM era. We argue that digital libraries are still indispensable, not only as repositories for digital preservation and provenance but also for trustworthy metadata discovery and verification. We explore how digital libraries can evolve by integrating LLMs and structured knowledge to support advanced services such as automatic data extraction, scholarly comparison, review generation, and science communication for broader audiences. We share preliminary work in this direction, including initiatives on preserving endangered open-access datasets and software, complex table data extraction, scientific claim verification, and assessing research reproducibility.
